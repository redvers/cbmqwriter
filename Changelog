Notable changes
===============

It appears that ets was becoming a bottleneck when the instrumentation
was enabled so changed the binary GC model from sensor GenServer termination
to per-process GC with each file-write sync.

As such, processes can now become permanent and automatically re-started
and logged by their supervisor.
